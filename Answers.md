1st Answer:  The relationship between these two tables is one-to-many. A product can belong to one category (represented by the category_id foreign key in the Product table), but a category can have many products. This is because a product can only be listed under one category, but a category can group many related products.


2nd Answer:  Use a Not Null Constraint: A NOT NULL constraint can be added to the category_id column in the "Product" table. This would prevent any new products from being added to the table without a valid category being assigned. However, this wouldn't fix any existing products that may already have a null value in the category_id column.

Set a Default Category:  A default category can be set for the category_id column in the "Product" table. This would ensure that any new product added to the table would automatically be assigned the default category if no other category was specified.

Use a Foreign Key Relationship: The current design uses a foreign key relationship between the Product and  Product_Category tables. The category_id column in the "Product" table is a foreign key that references the id column in the "Product_Category" table. This approach helps to ensure referential integrity, but it doesn't  automatically prevent invalid categories from being assigned.
